# Monetary Policy

#### Genesis Block

As part of the Ethereum [genesis block](../key-concepts/genesis-block.md), contributors to the Ethereum [pre-sale](../history/pre-mainnet.md#presale) were allocated 60,000,000 Ether. Another 12,000,000 Ether was given to the development fund which was distributed among early contributors and the remaining was allocated to the [Ethereum Foundation](../key-concepts/ethereum-foundation.md).

#### Block Rewards

Every block produced on the Ethereum network has an associated block reward which incentivizes miners to support the network. On top of that, miners that find an [uncle block](../key-concepts/uncle-block.md) also receive ~75% of the current block reward. This results in a growing supply of Ether across time. The history of the block reward are as follows:

* Block 0 to Block 4,369,999 : 5 Ether
* Block 4,370,000 to current: 3 Ether \(changed via [EIP-649](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-649.md)\)

{% hint style="info" %}
It is currently planned that in the Constantinople hard fork, which is targeted for the end of 2018, block rewards will drop to 2 Ether per block via [EIP-1234](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1234.md).
{% endhint %}

#### Supply Forecast

This following supply forecast assumes EIP-1234 is implement on 12/1/2018 and [Proof of Stake](../../roadmap/layer-2-scaling/) is implemented on 1/1/2020.
