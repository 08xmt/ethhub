### Genesis Block

As part of the Ethereum [genesis block](../key-concepts/genesis-block.md), initial contributors to Ethereum sale were allocated 60,000,000 Ether. Another 12,000,000 Ether was given to the development fund which was distributed among early contributors and the [Ethereum Foundation](../key-concepts/ethereum-foundation.md).

### Block Rewards

Every block produced on the Ethereum network has an associated block reward which incentivizes miners to support the network. On top of the base block reward, miners that find an [uncle block](../key-concepts/uncle-block.md) receive ~75% of the current block reward. This results in a growing supply of Ether across time. The history of the block reward are as follows:

* Block 0 to Block 4,369,999 : 5 Ether
* Block 4,370,000 to current: 3 Ether \(changed via [EIP-649](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-649.md)\)

{% hint style="info" %}
The Constantinople hard fork, targeted for the beginning of 2019, will cut block rewards to 2 Ether per block via [EIP-1234](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1234.md).

### Proof of Stake Impact

According to the current [Eth 2.0 spec](https://notes.ethereum.org/s/Syj3QZSxm), issuance rate will be greatly reduced as a part of Proof of Stake. There will be a [sliding scale](eth-2.0-economics.md#staking-rewards) between total amount of Ether at stake and annual interest earned by stakers. The current spec would produce the following annual interest and inflation numbers based on total network stake:

### Current Supply Forecast

There are three majors upcoming factors when it comes to Ethereum's issuance rate and supply curve. They are:

* Constantinopole Hard Fork: block rewards drop from 3 to 2.
* Serenity Phase 0: Slight bump in issuance due to Beacon Chain launch.
* Serenity Phase 2: Strong drop in issuance due to the PoW chain fading away.
