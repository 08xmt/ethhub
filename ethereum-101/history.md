# History

### Initial Concept

Vitalik Buterin first described the concept of Ethereum through the [White Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper). The vision was to put a generic scripting language on top of a blockchain.  
  
The concept was [publicly introduced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9dpjN3Mwps&t=1s) by Vitalik at Bitcoin Miami 2014.
