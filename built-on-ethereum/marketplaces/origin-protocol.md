# Origin Protocol

## Description

Origin Protocol creates an infrastructure for the open, general-purpose marketplace.

Users can create offers and put them into blockchain. Listings data is stored on IPFS, while the metadata is stored on Ethereum.

Origin Protocol doesnâ€™t impose any listing fees, essentially making it a totally free marketplace. Listing data is available for anyone to access and interact. Therefore, it is an open protocol that anyone can build on. For example, one can create a specialized marketplace by pulling listings related to some topic.
