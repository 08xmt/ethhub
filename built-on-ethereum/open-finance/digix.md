## Description

The platform allows buying and selling tokens tied to the price of gold. DGX is a gold-pegged token. Price of one DGX is equal to the price of one gram of gold.

An amount of gold that is equal to the total market cap of DGX tokens is stored in the vault. For each gold bar in the storage, a record will be created in the registry, with the link to the signed paper hosted on IPFS. Storage is audited by third parties, and the results of an audit are also published to IPFS and Ethereum.
