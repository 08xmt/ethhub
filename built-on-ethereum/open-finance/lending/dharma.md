# Dharma

## Description

Dharma is a protocol for issuing debt. The goal of this protocol is to create a pool of debtors and creditors.
Similar to 0x, Dharma utilizes the concept of relayers. The goal of relayers is to provide the interface to submit and gather orders. These orders are stored off-chain. Only settled orders go to the blockchain. It’s up to relayers to decide which orders they accept.

It is possible to take a loan without making collateral in cryptocurrency, or without collateral at all. Debtors can request a debt from one of the underwriters. An underwriter is an entity who evaluates debtor’s credibility and manages the debt parameters. Once debtor and underwriter settle, the latter submit the signed offer to one of the Dharma relays. Creditors can then evaluate offer’s terms and underwriter’s reputation to decide whether they trust it.

Recently the team introduced [Dharma Lever](https://lever.dharma.io/) — a margin trading platform built on the protocol.
