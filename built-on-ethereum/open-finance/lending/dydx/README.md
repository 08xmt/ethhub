# dYdX

## Description

dYdX provides an opportunity to trade derivatives on Ethereum.

Users of the protocol can trade with margin. This allows to short any ERC20 token or buy any token with leverage. Opening a position requires taking a debt. Therefore, margin trader will need to find a creditor who will lend the tokens. Users negotiate via relayers or in private, then settle on-chain once they agreed on terms.

dYdX also plans to support options trading. Options give a right to its owner to buy or sell an asset in the future at the specified price. It can be used as a speculation or hedging.
