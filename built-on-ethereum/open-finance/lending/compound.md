# Compound

## Description

Compound allows to borrow and lend tokens. In Compound, users contribute to the shared pool of tokens, from which lenders can receive a debt. Lenders can repay the debt at any time, as long as they maintain enough collateral. In case their debt becomes under collateralized, users of the protocol can default lenderâ€™s debt by selling his assets in the auction.

An interest rate of each lending and borrowing is defined by the size of the liquidity pool.
