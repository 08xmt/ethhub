# Dai

### Description

Dai is an asset backed stable currency created by the Maker Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The Dai Stablecoin System maintains the stable value of Dai by ensuring that each Dai is always backed by an asset of more value. MakerDAO is known as one of the earliest projects in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Importance

Crypto assets are known for their high volatity, rendering them unsuitable for medium of exchange. A stable crypto currency strives to become a medium of exchange by suppressing volatility and maintaining a consistant value through time. This innovation allows for individuals and business to enter into future agreements at a known cost. Just as one dollar today is approximately equal to one dollar tomorrow, people can be certain of their actual transaction costs.

### Accomplishments

The Dai Stablecoin System has been operating in Beta mode since December 2017. The Beta mode allowed for a single collateral type, Ether. During the period of Dec 2017 - September 2018, the price of Ether fell 87% while the Dai remained stable and overcollateraled throughout.

### Next

Multi-Collateral Dai is the next and full version of the Dai Stablecoin System. In this system all ERC-20 tokens are capable of being used as collateral for the Dai. Maker token holders will be responsible for voting in and setting risk parameters for each collateral type. The scope of collateral types are as wide as tokens issued on the Ethereum platform.
