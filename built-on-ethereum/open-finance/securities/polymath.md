# Polymath

## Description

Polymath aims to bring compliant securities to Ethereum in the form of tokens.

Any company can apply to issue securities in Polymath. Legal delegates review the application and place their bids. Issuer selects a delegate based on the bid and their past performance. The issuer should publish all required documentation, with the hash of the documents placed on the chain. In collaboration with the chosen legal delegate, he defines a set of restrictions to comply with regulators.

Investors can purchase securities from issuers as long as they fit compliance criteria. They will need to work with one of the KYC providers to bind their identity with their Ethereum address. Once they are approved, they can trade security tokens on primary and secondary markets.
