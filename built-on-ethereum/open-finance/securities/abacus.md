# Abacus

## Description

Abacus makes an ecosystem for financial applications and service providers.

Users can interact with financial applications. Under the hood, these applications communicate with smart contracts and service providers.

Service providers can be used for identity, compliance, and appraisal. They can run either on the chain or off the chain. In case the service is running off the chain, users should first request a quote for the service. After the user submitted the data and paid for the service, a provider will write results in the blockchain, where applications and the protocol can access it.
