# Harbor

## Description

Harbor works on the R-Token, token standard for the regulated trades.

Although blockchains like Ethereum are permissionless, and in theory anyone can create a token and distribute it on their own terms, issuing and trading securities is a heavily regulated space. The rules vary depending on the country and the type of security.

R-Token is a regulated token that can represent ownership of a security. It is based on the ERC-20 standard. Every time an investor transfers a token, smart contract checks Regulator Service to ensure that an investor has the right to make a particular transfer.

Regulator Service is an approved entity that verifies security token transfers based on KYC/AML rules, security regulations, vesting schedules, and participantsâ€™ identity.
