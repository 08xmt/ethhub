# Decentraland

## Description

Decentraland is an open virtual world that is open for modification and interaction.

Decentraland is a marketplace for buying and selling digital assets representing pieces of land in the virtual world. Initially, the land is distributed via auction. The winning bidder receives the ownership of a land. Then, he can trade it on a secondary market.

Each land has a scene where an owner can put 3D objects and code their interactions. Therefore, itâ€™s possible to create games and attractions.

The world will be accessible via VR browser on multiple platforms.
