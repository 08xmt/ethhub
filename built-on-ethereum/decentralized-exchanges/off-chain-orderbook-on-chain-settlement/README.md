# Off-Chain Orderbook, On-Chain Settlement

For "Off-Chain Orderbook, On-Chain Settlement" decentralized exchanges, final trades occur on chain but every order is hosted by a third party called a Relayer. This was the style of many early generation decentralized exchanges built on Ethereum.

### Pros

* Faster order management than On-Chain solutions
* Less fees involved than On-Chain solutions

### Cons

* No full guarantee that a maker order is still active
* The relayer could front run an order
